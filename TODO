:: HIGH :: make Distribution a * -> * kind and make Damage use a Distribution Int
make sample return m a instead of m Double

:: HIGH :: make generated random numbers all return Int, since that is all we use?


:: HIGH :: Make function to select Menu focus by matching 'shortcut'
Maybe call it MenuGroupSelect?
type MenuGroupSelect a = Menu (Bool, a)
with a pair of new mark/unmarkFocus functions

:: HIGH :: Add PickupItems port
Display a list of items

:: HIGH :: Fix InventoryView port
It should simply display a list of all items (don't worry about grouping all identical items),
but with one additional feature: mark items for drop with 'd' then drop all with D.

:: LOW :: Add ConfirmDropSelectedItems port
Simple yes/no display, with a list of to-be-dropped items underneath.

:: LOW :: FOV algorithm and fog of war
Keep a separate GridMap Glyph of the last visible tile state for the whole level,
where we store the highest priority INANIMATE glyph last seen,
so basically anything that is not an enemy. This will be used to
assign a glyph to the tiles outside of visible range

Furthermore, keep a separate GridMap Bool that is updated each player turn
that keeps track of visibility
and a GridMap Bool that keeps track of which tiles are vision-blocking
Potentially this could be isolated to some ST/IO mutable hash table
instead of a GridMap,
and computed in the handleEventZwerg function (which is MonadIO context)

Make a function to return the full Glyph for a player-visible tile,
and call this in the relevant UIBuiler

:: LOW, ONGOING :: add HasCallStack to more contexts

:: HIGH :: understand difference between INLINE and INLINABLE pragmas

:: LOW :: make a printEntity function

:: HIGH, COMPLETE :: Default Components
Make a function that takes EntityType as argument, and adds *only* the
100% essential default components.
This is one way to help guard against the problem of forgetting to update
every generator when a new component is added.

:: LOW, COMPLETE :: breakdown of Glyph
separate Glyph into GlyphBasic and Glyph (which is just two GlyphBasic's,
one for player visible and one for out of player vision range (fog))

:: HIGH, COMPLETE :: Stack trace in ZError
add StackTrace to ZError (only in GHC 8.2.X ? Nope, it is in )

:: HIGHEST, COMPLETE :: Create a Menu variant where you can select/deselect groups of items
Maybe call it MenuGroupSelect?
type MenuGroupSelect a = Menu (Bool, a)
with a pair of new mark/unmarkFocus functions
and a 'getAllSelected' function
